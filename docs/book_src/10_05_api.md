# Full usage instructions and API

HelloImGui is extremely easy to use: there is **one** main function in the API, with three overloads.

@import "src/hello_imgui/hello_imgui.h" {md_id=HelloImGui::Run}

Although the API is extremely simple, it is highly customizable, and you can set many options by filling the elements in the `RunnerParams` struct, or in the simpler  `SimpleRunnerParams`, or even by giving a subset of params to `HelloImGui::Run`.
